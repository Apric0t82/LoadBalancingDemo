# Load Balancing Demo

## Description

This solution provides a load balancing mechanism using the Round Robin algorithm. It includes a thread-safe implementation to handle concurrent requests efficiently. 
The solution is designed to distribute requests evenly across a list of servers, ensuring that each server gets an equal share of the load.

## Interesting Techniques

- **Round Robin Algorithm**: The core of the load balancing mechanism is based on the Round Robin algorithm, which cycles through a list of servers to distribute requests evenly.
- **Thread Safety**: The `ThreadSafeRoundRobinLoadBalancer` class ensures that the load balancing mechanism works correctly even when accessed by multiple threads concurrently. This is achieved using synchronization techniques to manage the state of the load balancer.
- **Unit Testing with Concurrent Tasks**: The unit tests include scenarios where multiple threads access the load balancer simultaneously, ensuring that the thread safety mechanisms are effective.

## Non-Obvious Technologies and Libraries

- **System.Collections.Concurrent**: This namespace provides thread-safe collection classes that are used to manage the list of servers in a concurrent environment.
- **System.Threading.Tasks**: This namespace is used to create and manage asynchronous tasks, which are essential for testing the thread safety of the load balancer.
- **xUnit**: A popular unit testing framework for .NET, used to write and run the unit tests for the load balancer. [xUnit Documentation](https://xunit.net/)
